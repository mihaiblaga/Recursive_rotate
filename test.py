## Variables

clock = pygame.time.Clock()
SCREEN = pygame.display.set_mode(pygame.display.list_modes()[-1])

radius = 50

# create the surface that will contain the circle image.
# circle will be drawn on its center, so surface width and height is 2*radius
circle = pygame.Surface((2*radius, 2*radius))

# Let's also paint the surface GREEN so you see its corners behind the circle
circle.fill((0, 255, 0))

# draw the circle on the surface instead of screen
pygame.draw.circle(circle, (255, 255, 255), (radius, radius), radius)

# Last but not the least, create a companion rect, based on surface's size
# A rect is just a tool to define width, height and position at the same time
rect = circle.get_rect()  

# rect now has same width and height as the surface,
# It's positioned at (0, 0) so let's move it to desired initial position

rect.x = 0  # instead of SCRENRECT.centerx, so it stays longer on screen
rect.y = SCREEN.get_rect().centery

# The surface (and our friend the rect) is set up and ready to be used on screen
